# The-Most-Common-Passwords-Pin-e-ScreenLocks

Dear programmers friends! I'm happy to share this little passwords study with you ...
The package consists of several images with statistics on passwords, screenlocks and the most used pins, statistics on the length of the passwords etc.

Thanks to these simple lists, in the hanni I hacked dozens of devices, and I tell you one thing, they have a very high success rate ...
The list of hacked devices includes: Android Smartphones, Iphone, Ipod, Tablets, Ipad, Ipod, Symbian Phones, Blackberry,Nintendo 3DS, TV, Smart TV, Nav, Windows Computers, Macos and incredibly also a couple of installations linux :(

I hope you enjoy it
